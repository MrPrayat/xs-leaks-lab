    <h1>Welcome to the Attacker Site</h1>
    <p>
        By clicking the links below, you will exploit the website http://victim.local:8080.
        You can test the XS-Leak attacks by trying to load one page that exists and one that does not,
        then look at their response status codes to exploit this leak of information and determine if the page exists or not.
        This is a proof of concept of the XS-Leak attack where the page we're accessing could be an admin page, and we can determine if the user has access to it or not.
        We could also try accessing pages with specific values for specific IDs, and determine if the user has access to them or not.
